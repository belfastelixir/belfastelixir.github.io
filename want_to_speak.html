<h2>Want to Speak?</h2>

<p>We want to  meet every two or three months. There should typically two
talks. Sometimes there’ll be pizza.</p>

<p>To stay informed about our upcoming meetings you can keep up to date with
#events or #elixir channels on <a
href='http://nitech.herokuapp.com/'>Nitech</a>. Alternativley you can subscribe
to the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Belfast-Elixir/">meetup</a> page.</p>

<p>
Our goal is to accept any offered talk. If your talk is obviously about Elixir
there’s no question about it; you can definitely give your talk. If it’s not so
obviously about Elixir it is also welcome as one of the most important things
you can do is see what is happening outside of our limited scope (as long as
there is a hook back to Elixir).  We’re quite an open-minded group, so the hook
doesn’t have to be that clear. In the unlikely event that it turns out that
Elixir isn’t a good home for your talk, we’ll do our best to come up with some
alternative ideas for places you could give it.
</p>


<h2>Subject Matter</h2>

<p>
We are mixed-ability crowd; we have talks from first-timers just learning
Elixir all the way up to people that have been using it for years. This means
you can pitch your talk at any level and someone will get something out of it.
It’s also a mostly technical crowd, so don’t shy away from getting into the
nitty gritty of your topic. We’d prefer an in-depth discussion of a single
aspect to a shallow overview of the whole thing.
</p>


<p>
Your talk should observe the code of conduct. Any talks that don’t will be
stopped and the speaker asked to leave.
</p>

<p>
If you are using the projector you should favour large fonts and a high
contrast colour scheme with dark text on a light background in anything you
show. The default settings for most presentation applications are a safe bet,
but you might have to re-configure your terminal or editor if you are using
those for anything. Also note that while the projector will cope with most
screen resolutions, it works best at 1024x768. Most presentation applications
will automatically resize, but you might want to check your slides at that
resolution.
